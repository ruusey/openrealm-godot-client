class_name PortalInput
extends RefCounted

## The three ways out of a realm: the portal under your feet, the nexus, and
## the vault.
##
## The sequence is the one both references follow and neither improvises:
## send UsePortalPacket, tear the realm down locally, then send LoginAckPacket
## -- which is what asks the server for the next map's tiles. Acking every
## LoadMapPacket instead looks equivalent and is not; LoadMap also fires once
## per tile-stream chunk.

## The flags are bytes and the server tests them against -1, not 0
## (`isToVault()` is `toVault != -1`), so "no" has to be spelled -1 or every
## portal enters the vault.
const OFF := -1
const ON := 1
## Portal id 2 is the vault, and it MUST travel as the toVault variant: that
## is the only branch on the server that sets the chests up. Sent as an
## ordinary portal it routes by toRealmId and lands you somewhere empty.
const VAULT_PORTAL := 2
## How close counts as standing on it, in world pixels. The web client's 64;
## the native takes 32, which is stricter than the server requires.
const REACH_PX := 64.0
## The native's PORTAL_COOLDOWN_MS, so a held key cannot fire again into the
## realm still being streamed to us.
const COOLDOWN := 1.0

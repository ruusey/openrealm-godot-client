## What the party panel and the invite prompt send.
##
## The server drives parties by command -- /party invite, accept, decline,
## leave and kick, the same lines the chat could send -- and answers on
## PartyUpdatePacket and SYSTEM text. Accept and decline drop the prompt
## at once rather than waiting for the reply, as both references do.

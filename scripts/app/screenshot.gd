## The ` key (tilde, top-left): the frame on screen, as a PNG, wherever this build can put one.
##
## On the desktop it is written under user://screenshots and the path
## printed; a browser has no filesystem the player can reach, so there the
## bytes go out as a download through the page. Both take the viewport as
## drawn -- the world, every panel and the overlay -- which is what a report
## of "it looks wrong" needs to show.

const FOLDER := "user://screenshots"


## Returns where the image went, or "" when there was nothing to take -- the
## texture reads back null headless.

## The keys that cast: 1, 2 and 3 for the three hotbar slots, and the right
## mouse button as the web client's shortcut for the first.
##
## Shift with a digit is the bag's (InventoryInput), so a digit only casts
## with Shift up -- the web client gates the same way, after pressing 1 to
## cast also swapped the weapon. K opens the skills panel -- in a realm only,
## since a K typed into the password field is not a request for it.

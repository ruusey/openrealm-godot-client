## The ack is what ends the session: the server disconnects us in response to
## it rather than on its own, so a client that closes first never acks and its
## session lingers behind its own heartbeat. We deliberately do not close from
## here -- on the web path a send is queued rather than written, and closing
## before the next poll drops it.
##
## It is acked even though the server may have just revived us with a Crown of
## Resurrection: the death packet is sent before that branch, both references
## ack unconditionally, and staying connected is worse than a trip through the
## character picker -- our id is already in the server's expired list, which
## only a realm reset clears, and a player left in it stops dying at all.

## The keys that reach into the bag without pointing at it.
##
## The web client's bindings: F picks up, Z and X drink, and Shift with a
## digit uses or equips one of the first eight backpack slots -- Shift
## because a bare digit casts the ability in that hotbar slot, and before the
## gate, pressing 1 to cast also swapped the weapon mid-fight. Tab shows and
## hides the panel, which is ours: both references keep theirs up always.
##
## Nothing here acts outside a realm. Tab is how a player moves from the
## email field to the password field on the login screen, and a Tab there
## once hid the bag before they had ever seen it.

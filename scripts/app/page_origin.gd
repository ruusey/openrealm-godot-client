## The address the page itself was served from.
##
## A browser has no command line, so --host never reaches a web build and the
## desktop default would point every player at their own machine. The page's
## own origin is the one address that is right by construction: the data
## service serves the client, so it is also where the content comes from.
##
## Only the host, its scheme and its port come from here. The game server's
## WebSocket listener is a port of its own rather than the one the page
## arrived on, so the game port is left alone.
##
## One exception, and it is the whole of the production setup: a page served
## from openrealm.net -- the domain or any subdomain -- talks to openrealm.net
## over TLS, whatever the build and whatever port the page came from. Anywhere else (localhost, an address, a staging box) talks
## to its own origin, which is what a dev setup expects.

## What a url that names no port of its own implies, per scheme.

class_name ContentGaps
extends RefCounted

## Things the shipped content refers to that were never shipped with it.
##
## These are bugs in openrealm-data, not in the client, and the client cannot
## fix them -- it can only decide whether to shout about each one on every
## launch. Listing a sheet here says "known, already understood, not worth a
## warning banner". It is deliberately not silence: check-content.sh still
## prints them, so a gap cannot quietly become permanent, and anything *not*
## on this list still fails that check.
##
## Each entry carries why it is here, so removing it later is a decision
## someone can make without re-deriving the reason.

## sheet -> why it is here. Empty today: the one entry there was,
## lofi_char.png for enemy 263, went when openrealm-data repointed that enemy
## at lofiCharacter10x10.png (11320fe), and check-content.sh now fails on an
## entry like that one -- listed, but named by nothing -- so the list cannot
## outlive what it excuses. An entry reads:
##   "some_sheet.png": "enemy 123 (Name) placeholder; sheet never shipped",
const MISSING_SHEETS := {}

## The list in force; a test sets its own and puts this back.

## Every entry that no longer excuses anything: nothing the content names
## asks for it, or the sheet now resolves. Each is a line saying which, and
## to remove it.

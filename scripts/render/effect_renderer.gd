class_name EffectRenderer
extends Node2D

## What a cast leaves on the ground, and who is still casting.
##
## Drawn between the bullets and the labels: over the entities, under the
## names. Each effect type is drawn by its own file under render/effects,
## found through Fx.for_type by the wire's `effectType`; anything without
## one gets FxGeneric, the native client's generic form in the hue its
## table gives the type.
## Both references draw all sixty-odd types by hand (the web client in one
## switch, the native in one 3,500-line class); here a new type is one file
## and one line in Fx. A drawer takes the canvas, the effect, its progress
## in 0..1, its tier colour and its age in ms, and draws in world space.

## The web client's TIER_COLORS, T0 silver through T6 purple.

## What an effect can reach: its radius around where it stands, and along
## to its far end when it has one -- a boss's beam, a dash, a thrown lob.
## An area effect sends no target (the server writes 0,0), so a zero one
## is not a point to reach, or every effect would stretch to the origin.

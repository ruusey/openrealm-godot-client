## An outline is 4 extra draw calls per sprite (SpriteOutline). Players and enemies
## always get one -- they're few and the focus -- but loot bags and portals are static
## props, and a room strewn with ~100 of each would otherwise add 4 draws EACH every
## frame, the dominant cost of the loot-pile FPS drop. Cap how many static props get an
## outline per frame; the rest draw plain. Normal play (a handful of bags) is under the
## cap, so it only bites the pathological pile.

## Shadows go down in a pass of their own, ahead of the bodies, so the
## ellipses batch instead of alternating with a texture draw per entity. The
## native client separates them for the same reason; the web client parents
## each shadow to its own entity and gets the same picture, because the queue
## is sorted on feet -- a later entity is always lower, so its shadow can
## never reach the body of one already drawn. Measured: interleaving the two
## loops renders byte-identical output.

## taller frame grows upward, and a wider one grows away from the body --
## rightward as authored, leftward once mirrored -- so the overhanging part of
## a swing always lands on the side the character is facing. Get the mirrored
## case wrong and the weapon sticks out of the character's back.

## Missing art becomes a solid block in the entity's fallback colour, so a
## content gap is visible on screen rather than silently absent.
##
## Mirroring goes through a scale transform. draw_texture_rect's last argument
## is `transpose`, which swaps the X and Y axes -- passing a flip there draws a
## side-facing sprite rotated onto its side, which reads as the character
## facing downward while it walks left. A negative-width Rect2 mirrors but
## also displaces the sprite, so neither shortcut works.
## Where an entity's body lands and which slice of its sheet shows.
##
## Everything a caller would otherwise have to read back off a canvas: a
## standing entity draws its whole frame, and one in a liquid sinks by three
## tenths and is clipped to its cell, so the legs go under the surface. Done
## to the rect and the slice rather than with a mask, because an
## immediate-mode layer has no per-command mask to do it with.

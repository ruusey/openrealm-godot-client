## A real-3D view of the realm, behind the ?3d=1 flag: the ground textured
## quads (MultiMesh), the walls extruded boxes (MultiMesh), and every prop,
## player, enemy, loot, portal and projectile a sprite in 3D -- the same art the
## 2D renderer draws. Standing things (props, characters) are upright Y-billboards
## with a ground shadow; projectiles lie flat on the ground
## rotated to their heading; the ability effects are the real 2D EffectRenderer
## projected onto the floor. The pinned overlay (names, bars, damage numbers,
## bubbles, loot) is the real EntityOverlay, driven through this view's 3D camera
## rather than re-drawn -- see _update_overlay. The 2D WorldRenderer is hidden.
##
## World space is the 2D world's own pixels: 2D (x, y) is 3D (x, 0, y), y up.
## Performance: ground/walls are MultiMesh (one draw call per tile texture) built
## once per map, not per move; sprites are pooled and updated in place.
##
## A prototype: aim/movement still read the 2D camera, so they are not yet
## relative to the orbit angle.

## The ground is the 2D TileRenderer (base tiles + feather blending) rendered into

class_name BulletRenderer
extends Node2D

## Draws projectiles, after the ground pass and without sorting.
##
## Bullets read better over the top of everything, which is what the reference
## client does too. Separate from EntityRenderer because nothing here sorts,
## mirrors or animates -- a bullet is a sprite rotated onto its heading.
##
## Two exceptions: a MELEE_SWING is an invisible area effect that the wielder's
## swing animation stands in for, and a LINE_SEGMENT wall is a row of sprites
## rather than one.
##
## The sprites themselves are MultiMesh instances, one MultiMesh per sheet drawn
## into a canvas item of its own under bullet.gdshader, which also draws their
## silhouettes: a whole sheet's shots, outlined, are one draw call and two
## instance writes each, where drawing them one by one was six commands a shot.

## Silhouettes cost nothing per shot on the GPU path, so every shot gets one; this
## caps only shots drawn the slow way (a sheet too large for the MultiMesh path).

## only up to here; a larger sheet's shots are drawn one by one instead.

## drawn first, so the closest keep their trail) — the rest still draw, just flat.

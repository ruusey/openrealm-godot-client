class_name ChatPanel
extends CanvasLayer

## The chat log the server and other players produce.
##
## Shows a compact tail by default (the last few lines, sitting on the bottom
## margin), and EXPANDS into a scrollback of the whole ring when the mouse is over
## it, the input line is open, or (on a touchscreen) the log was touched. The ring
## itself lives in ChatLog (newest in, oldest out); this panel only renders it.
##
## Enter opens a line to type into, under the log; while it is open the panel
## captures the keyboard, and Screens tells every polled input so -- without the
## gate, typing walks the player and fires.
##
## One row per line (ChatRow) rather than one label for all of them: a SYSTEM
## line and a player line are different colours, and a long line wraps.

## Tail height (rows) when collapsed, and the viewport height when expanded. The
## expanded viewport is also capped to a fraction of the screen so it never runs
## off the top on a short (phone) display.

## sizes -- its uiLayer: name 16px bold with a 3px stroke just over the bars,
## bars as wide as the sprite and 4 tall, 28 under the feet; an enemy gets
## one bar over it only while hurt. The tag is placed at the sprite's screen
## top-left and sized to the sprite, so every child is an offset from it.

## to the tag, so when the sprite size and these values are unchanged only the
## tag's own position moves -- which is the common case every frame the camera
## scrolls but the character's name/HP/mana did not change. Gating on them skips
## re-shaping the labels (reset_size) and recolouring the bars per entity per frame.
## A pooled tag is bound to one entity for its whole life, so the cache never goes stale.

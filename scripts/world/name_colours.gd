class_name NameColours
extends RefCounted

## What colour a player's name is, by chat role, wherever it is written.
##
## The web client keeps two tables, and they disagree on one entry. Over a
## head and in the nearby list a name with no role is off-white
## (renderer.js getNameColorHex, main.js getNameColorCSS); in the chat log
## it is blue (main.js getNameColor's DEFAULT_NAME_COLOR), and a couple of
## senders that are not players at all have a colour of their own by name
## (CHAT_NAME_COLORS). The roles themselves are the same five everywhere,
## and the native client's roleColorFor uses the same five.
##
## The role is whatever the server calls it: NetPlayer.chatRole on the
## roster, and on a player's chat line the TextPacket's `to`, which the
## server fills with the sender's role (ServerGameLogic's rebroadcast).

## The name over a character. The local player keeps its own green -- how
## you pick yourself out of a crowd -- until it holds a role, and then it is
## the role's colour, as the web client shows it: its own comment says an
## admin has to see their own colour on their own character.

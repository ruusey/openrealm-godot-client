extends RefCounted

## The nine account-wide skills and the server's level curve.
##
## `SkillsPacket` carries only XP totals, one per `PlayerSkill` ordinal; the
## level, the bar and every line of text are derived here. The curve is the
## server's (`PlayerSkillHelper`: total XP for level L is 510 L^2, capped at
## 99), and the text is the web client's (`SKILL_NAMES`, `SKILL_DESC`,
## `SKILL_EFFECT`, `SKILL_XP_RULE`), which mirrors the server's award rates.

const CURVE_K := 510
const MAX_LEVEL := 99

## Name, what it covers, its effect a level, the per-level percent and what
## it boosts, and how XP is earned. Indexed by the server's ordinal.

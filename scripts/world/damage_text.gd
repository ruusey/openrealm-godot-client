## The numbers that float off whatever just got hit.
##
## Driven entirely by TextEffectPacket: the server decides what the text says
## and, for a bullet hit, exactly where it struck -- so the number lands where
## the shot connected even though the enemy has moved by the time the packet
## arrives. A zero position means "wherever the target is now", which is what
## heals, status feedback and AoE pulses send.

## The web client counts frames at 60fps; these are the same numbers in
## seconds. Its renderer fades against a shorter life than its model decays
## by -- the two drifted apart upstream -- which leaves a fresh number at full
## alpha for its first fifth of a second and then fades it.

## Stacking keeps a burst legible: same-lane numbers within this horizontal
## distance step upward instead of covering each other.
const STACK_PX := 20.0
## The native client's step, not the web client's 8. The two differ because
## the web draws its text in SCREEN space, where 8 world units is 16 px at
## this zoom and clears a 14 px glyph; we draw in world space, like the native
## does, so the step has to be measured in the same units as the text -- at 8
## a burst renders on top of itself.

## Status labels ride a lane above the damage, so a shot's number and the
## status it applies never overlap.

## Rise rate in world pixels per second. The web client floats its text in
## screen space at 0.66px per frame; at the 2x zoom the client runs, that is

## Eight shots landing together read as one number, not eight.

## The web client compares against the text it has already rewritten to carry
## the count, so in practice it merges once and then starts a new number --
## which its own comment ("8 wizard shots -> one big number") says is not what
## it means to do. Keeping the original text to compare against is that
## comment's behaviour.
## The web client also compares lanes here. That cannot decide anything: the
## colour is a function of the effect id and all five differ, so a status
## label and a damage number are already separated by the colour test above
## it. Left out rather than carried as a condition no input can reach.

## Which tile is meant is the web client's rule, and it is also the server's
## check: the nearest tile with an `interactionType`, on either layer, in the
## five-by-five window around the tile the player stands on, and no further
## than three tiles from the player's corner. The server refuses anything
## further with a log line and nothing the client can see.

## What the server and the other players have said.
##
## One flat ring, oldest dropped first. Both references cap it at 50 -- the
## web client's model and the native's PlayerChat -- and the cap is not
## cosmetic: the web client's own comment records what an uncapped log cost
## it, 1500-3000 retained lines after half an hour and 2-5 ms of layout per
## frame, which lands as ack jitter and then as reconciliation desync.
##
## The log survives a realm change, which is the web client's behaviour; the
## native wipes it per realm. It goes on disconnect, with the rest of the
## session.

## Minimap payload wearing a chat packet's clothes -- `ADD|id|boss|x|y|name`,
## rebroadcast every three seconds while a realm event is live. The web client
## returns before its log ("never display in chat"); the native appends it and
## then only skips the bubble, which is why its chat fills with coordinates.

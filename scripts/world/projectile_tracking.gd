extends RefCounted

## The two v0.9.0 motion types that depend on another entity.
##
## HOMING steers its heading toward a target each tick; ANCHORED snaps back to
## its source entity, so a wall summoned by an enemy travels with it. Both
## live here rather than in ProjectileMotion because they need to look
## entities up, and the integrator deliberately knows nothing about the world.
##
## When the entity has gone -- unloaded, or killed -- the server leaves the
## bullet where it is until its lifetime runs out, and so do we.


## Records where the bullet sits relative to its source, so it can be snapped
## back every tick afterwards. Mirrors Bullet.setupAnchor.
##
## Captured against the source's RAW latest-snapshot position, not its
## interpolated render position: the server anchored the wall to the entity's
## live server position, and anchored walls ride a bullets-only load delta that
## carries no fresh enemy snapshot, so subtracting the ~100ms-delayed render
## position baked that lag into the offset -- which deformed a boss's wall-box
## (each side captured a tick apart as it entered view, with a different lag).
